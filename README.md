1) Technology Stack <br>
   HTML <br>
   CSS <br>
   Django <br>
   Jquery <br>
   Javascript <br>
   AJAX <br>
   API call<br>
   <br>
2) Contents and Style applied<br>
   As per task defined the filter card was created as static while other launches card were created dynamically as per number of contents. <br>
   Website was designed responsive using custom media query which style html page acording to display width ie. mobile, tablet and desktop view.<br>
   While launch info was fetch from spacex API call the image was stylized accordingly. <br>
   Font applied for overall webpage is in "Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;" format. <br>
   Logo used for website is from "Icon8" website as embedded html.<br>
   <br>
3) Hosting <br>
   There are multiple hosting services such as Heroku, codelab, AWS, Azure, GCP, DigitalOcean,etc. <br>
   I have hosted this website on heroku. Heroku is a cloud platform as a service (PaaS) supporting several programming languages. As it provide python running application to host, which this website was developed on.<br>
   As it have build pack as python so django is able to work on serverside updates for the site.<br>
   <br>
4) Learning <br>
   I learned lot about webdevelopment while working on this project.<br>
   It helped me to get more comfortable with html, css, javascript, django and jquery. <br>
   New things I learned was about AJAX call which is used to update page without refreshing it. <br>
   Also learned how to create dinamic website and work with API calls to colled data and use acordingly. <br>
   <br>
5) Lighthouse score <br>
   Overall score:<br>
   ![alt text](https://github.com/himanshusankhala04/spaceExp/blob/master/lightscore.PNG?raw=true)<br>
   
   Because of api call limit is 100 there is slow loading time which leads to performace drop and also image taking some time to load. <br>
   This can be improve further by displaying light weight images to the site or load site partially as per 100% dispalyed or by using multithreading approach. <br>
   
   <br>
6) Potential changes to make for website to look better will be to go tor React js for more user friendly UI.<br>
   More over it requires some featur update such as need of search bar for searching, api call data fetching limit in filter, button to get more info about Launches, etc<br> 
   I have added one feature to it ie. clear filter button.<br>
